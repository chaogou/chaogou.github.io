I am currently an Associate Professor at the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University.
I received the B.S. degree from the University of Electronic Science and
Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2012 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) supervised by
Prof. [Fei-Yue Wang](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wangfeiyue?language=en), Beijing, China, in 2017. From 2015 to 2017, I was supported by UCAS as a joint-supervision Ph.D student in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA. My
co-advisor is Prof. [Qiang Ji](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~qji/). 

My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, pattern recognition and their applications in driver behavior monitoring, human computer 
interaction, medical image analysis, autonomous driving and automatic scene perception in intelligent transportation systems.
